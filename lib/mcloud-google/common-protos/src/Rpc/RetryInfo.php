 * Describes when the clients can retry a failed request. Clients could ignore

 * retrying.
 * Clients should wait until `retry_delay` amount of time has passed since
 * receiving the error response before retrying.  If retrying requests also
 * fail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase
 * the delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum
 * number of retries have been reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been
 * reached.
