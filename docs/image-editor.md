# Image Editor
The default image editor that ships with WordPress leaves a lot to be desired.  Media Cloud completely replaces that antiquity with an image editor that allows you to apply effects, make image adjustments, arbitrary rotations, set focal points for focused crops and much much more.

You must be using Imgix or Dynamic Images to be able to use the image editor.
