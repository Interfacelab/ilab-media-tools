# Direct Uploads
The Direct Upload feature of Media Cloud allows you to upload directly to your cloud storage provider, bypassing your WordPress server completely.  Because your WordPress server never handles an upload, you must use Imgix or Dynamic Images because no thumbnails or resized images will be generated by WordPress and must be done so on the fly.

## Upload Settings

### Integrate with Media Library
When this option is enabled, performing any uploads through WordPress's media library will perform direct uploads.  If this option is off you will have to use the [Cloud Upload](admin:upload.php?page=media-cloud-upload) page to do direct uploads.

### Number of Simulataneous Uploads
This is the number of simulataneous uploads you'll be able to perform if **Integrate with Media Library** is enabled.  The max value is 8.

### Detect Faces
Enabling this will use browser based javascript machine learning to detect faces in your uploads.  Detected faces will be stored as additional metadata for the image. If you are using Imgix or Dynamic Images, you can use this for cropping images centered on a face. 

If you are relying on this functionality, the better option would be to use the Vision tool. It is more accurate with less false positives. If Vision is enabled, this setting is ignored in favor of Vision's results.
